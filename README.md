Detecting Parkinson's Disease in patients using voice samples, through various ML models and using SHAP plots to interpret the results
Development and comparison of various Machine Learning Algorithms for detecting Parkinson's Disease from medical features observed in
the patient voice recordings. Two datasets containing features of voice samples collected from individuals were used . The models 
included Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression. 
The models were tuned using Grid Search and Genetic Algorithm Search. In order to expand the scope of the models, and to make them
more trustworthy for the general populace, the results of these models were made interpretable for non-experts using SHAP values and 
summary plots.
